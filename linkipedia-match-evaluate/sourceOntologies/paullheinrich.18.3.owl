    <rdfs:label>metabolic probing (1 of 4) - substrate In order to study controls on metabolic processes in soils, we determined the dynamics of 13CO2 production from two position-specific 13C-labeled pyruvate isotopologues in the presence and absence of glucose, succinate, pine, and legume leaf litter, and under anaerobic conditions. We observed that the C from the carboxyl group (C1) of pyruvate was lost as CO2 much faster than its other C atoms (C2,3). Addition of glucose, pine and legume leaf litter reduced the ratio between 13CO2 production from 1-13C pyruvate and 2,3-13C pyruvate (C1/C2,3 ratio), whereas anaerobic conditions increased this ratio. We interpret a low C1/C2,3 ratio as an indication of increased Krebs cycle activity in response to carbon inputs, while a higher ratio implies a reduced Krebs cycle activity in response to anaerobic conditions. Succinate, a gluconeogenic substrate, reduced 13CO2 production from pyruvate to near zero, likely reflecting increased carbohydrate biosynthesis from
Krebs cycle intermediates. The difference in 13CO2 production rate from pyruvate isotopologues disappeared 4-5 days after pyruvate addition, indicating that C positions were scrambled by ongoing soil microbial transformations. This work demonstrates that metabolic tracers such as pyruvate can be used to determine qualitative aspects of C flux patterns through metabolic pathways of soil microbial communities. at% of CO2 in headspace after (min) at% of CO2 in headspace after (min) At% is 100 * fraction of the heavy isotope divided by the sum of all isotopes in a sample

The symbol â° is spelled out in several different ways: permil, per mil, per mill, or per mille. The term "per mill" is the ISO term, but is not yet widely used. ï¤ values are calculated by: 
	(in â°) = (Rsample/Rstandard - 1)1000
where "R" is the ratio of the heavy to light isotope in the sample or standard. For the elements sulfur, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, the average terrestrial abundance ratio of the heavy to the light isotope ranges from 1:22 (sulfur) to 1:500 (oxygen); the ratio 2H:1H is 1:6410. A positive ï¤ value means that the sample contains more of the heavy isotope than the standard; a negative ï¤ value means that the sample contains less of the heavy isotope than the standard. A ï¤15N value of +30â° means that there are 30 parts-per-thousand or 3% more 15N in the sample relative to the standard.

    <rdfs:label>metabolic probing (1 of 4) - substrate In order to study controls on metabolic processes in soils, we determined the dynamics of 13CO2 production from two position-specific 13C-labeled pyruvate isotopologues in the presence and absence of glucose, succinate, pine, and legume leaf litter, and under anaerobic conditions. We observed that the C from the carboxyl group (C1) of pyruvate was lost as CO2 much faster than its other C atoms (C2,3). Addition of glucose, pine and legume leaf litter reduced the ratio between 13CO2 production from 1-13C pyruvate and 2,3-13C pyruvate (C1/C2,3 ratio), whereas anaerobic conditions increased this ratio. We interpret a low C1/C2,3 ratio as an indication of increased Krebs cycle activity in response to carbon inputs, while a higher ratio implies a reduced Krebs cycle activity in response to anaerobic conditions. Succinate, a gluconeogenic substrate, reduced 13CO2 production from pyruvate to near zero, likely reflecting increased carbohydrate biosynthesis from
Krebs cycle intermediates. The difference in 13CO2 production rate from pyruvate isotopologues disappeared 4-5 days after pyruvate addition, indicating that C positions were scrambled by ongoing soil microbial transformations. This work demonstrates that metabolic tracers such as pyruvate can be used to determine qualitative aspects of C flux patterns through metabolic pathways of soil microbial communities. replicate replicate replicate number</rdfs:label>

    <rdfs:label>d13C of CO2 in headspace after (min) d13C of CO2 in headspace after (min) â¢	The stable isotopic compositions of low-mass (light) elements such as oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur are normally reported as "delta" (ï¤) values in parts per thousand (denoted as â°) enrichments or depletions relative to a standard of known composition. The symbol â° is spelled out in several different ways: permil, per mil, per mill, or per mille. The term "per mill" is the ISO term, but is not yet widely used. ï¤ values are calculated by: 
	(in â°) = (Rsample/Rstandard - 1)1000
where "R" is the ratio of the heavy to light isotope in the sample or standard. For the elements sulfur, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, the average terrestrial abundance ratio of the heavy to the light isotope ranges from 1:22 (sulfur) to 1:500 (oxygen); the ratio 2H:1H is 1:6410. A positive ï¤ value means that the sample contains more of the heavy isotope than the standard; a negative ï¤ value means that the sample contains less of the heavy isotope than the standard. A ï¤15N value of +30â° means that there are 30 parts-per-thousand or 3% more 15N in the sample relative to the standard.
