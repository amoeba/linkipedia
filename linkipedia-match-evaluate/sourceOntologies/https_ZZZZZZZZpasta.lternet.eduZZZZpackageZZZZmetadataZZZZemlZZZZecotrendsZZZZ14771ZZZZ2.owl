    <rdfs:comment>The EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters 
(Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and 
Dr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo  LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) 
to support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. 
The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility 
and use of long-term data.  At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded 
research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, 
including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by 
the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, 
US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. 
      

Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal 
(http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data
compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application.
Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic
processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking
Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER 
and the LTER Network Office.

contains plant cover of Lycium pallidum (pale desert-thorn) measurements in percent units
and were aggregated to a yearly timescale.</rdfs:comment>
