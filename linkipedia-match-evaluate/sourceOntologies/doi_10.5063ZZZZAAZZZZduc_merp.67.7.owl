Identification to family was adequate, however Chironomidae were further classified to the Tanypodinae subfamily (predator) and all other subfamilies as Non-Tanypodinae (herbivore).

seven-digit species code can be further divided into taxons of specific levels

digits 1-2 = order
digits 3-4 = family
digit 5    = subfamily
digit 6    = genus
digit 7    = species

please note:
- missing values (sample lost, equipment malfunction, recording failure) in respective columns are represented by having two consecutive commas occur within the sample row.
- 1 3400000 individual will have a biomass of 0 mg.
- species codes of 0000000 represents zero individuals found in sample.
- site locations of lost samples will be listed in the sample frame, but not in the final data.</rdfs:label>

The representative individuals were from each taxa and sample type were rinsed with distilled water and then placed in weighed and dried (105ºC for 24 hrs.) aluminum pans. The invertebrates were then dried at 105 ºC overnight and the pans were weighed again the following day. When 500 individuals of the same taxon or size class had been collected and weighed, where the mean weight was < 1.0mg, and 200 individuals from any taxa had a mean weight > 1.0 mg, these groups no longer had to be dried for their dry-weight determination (Ross and Murkin, 1989).

    <rdfs:label>Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP): Substrate core data (1980-1982)</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment>The Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was a long-term interdisciplinary study on the ecology of prairie wetlands. A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes substrate core data, collected as part of the invertebrate setion of MERP.
	 Invertebrate monitoring during the Marsh Ecology Research Project (MERP) has explored the effects of short- and long-term water level and associated vegetation changes on invertebrate populations. This project has produced an extensive and multi-faceted data set depicting the distribution and variation of invertebrates within a prairie wetland in flux. At each sample site during the baseline and deep flooding phases of the MERP, core samples were collected in order to obtain estimates of benthic invertebrates found in the experimental cells.

    <rdfs:label><![CDATA[total_biomass_mg total biomass of sample (mg) A representative sample of all invertebrate taxa and size classes from all sorted samples (with the exception of emergence trap samples) were kept to determine biomass. The representative individuals were from each taxa and sample type were rinsed with distilled water and then placed in weighed and dried (105ºC for 24 hrs.) aluminum pans. The invertebrates were then dried at 105 ºC overnight and the pans were weighed again the following day. When 500 individuals of the same taxon or size class had been collected and weighed, where the mean weight was < 1.0mg, and 200 individuals from any taxa had a mean weight > 1.0 mg, these groups no longer had to be dried for their dry-weight determination (Ross and Murkin, 1989).
