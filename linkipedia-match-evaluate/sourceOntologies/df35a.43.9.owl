    <rdfs:label>Chinook salmon release program in Crab Bay, Evans Island, Alaska: 1994-1997</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment>Abstract: Chinook salmon incubated and reared at Wally Noerenberg Hatchery were released in Crab Bay, adjacent to the native community of Chenega. Adult salmon returning to the site of release will provide replacement resources and associated services injured by the Exxon Valdez  oil spill. Three releases have taken place (1994, 1995, 1996) as part of this multi-year project. Adult salmon will begin returning in 1996 and 1997, with larger numbers projected at nearly 1,000 adult fish, returning in 1998 and thereafter.

Studv History: 50,000 chinook salmon smolt were released in the summers of 1994, 1995 and 1996 at Crab Bay on Evans Island, Prince William Sound as part of an ongoing Trustee Council program to replace injured subsistence resources and services (Restoration Projects 94272,95272 and 96272). Chinook salmon return varying between adult ages of 4 and 7 years. A few adults are anticipated to begin returning in 1996, with nearly 1,000 returning in 1998 as the age classes build and releases continue. Chinook salmon returning to Prince William Sound Aquaculture Corporation's Wally Noerenberg Hatchery (WNH) at Esther Island were harvested as brood stock. Eggs were taken and incubated at the hatchery and the resultant fry reared for an additional year to smolt size. 50,000 smolt were released at Crab Bay. This annual cycle will continue through 1998.
