    <rdfs:comment>This study considers the relative role of competition and facilitation in primary succession of the boreal forest floodplain of Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest. Alder (Alnus tenuifolia Nutt.) is an early colonist of young floodplain sites, where it contributes greatly to soil development through the addition of nitrogen to the soil. White spruce (Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss) typically colonizes such sites later; it becomes established beneath a canopy of alder and willow (Salix spp.) which is sometimes overtopped by young balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.). The alder may potentially influence white spruce both positively and negatively. Possible facilitative effects include protection of small seedlings from excess heat or heavy siltation accompanying flooding and addition of soil nitrogen, an effect that may extend for many years. Competition for light (and other resources) before the white spruce has overtopped the alder canopy may prove to be a major negative effects. This study seeks to determine the net balance of these effects on the floodplain successional sequence by planting spruce seedlings with and without the presence of alder. Plots of white spruce seedlings were planted in 1989 on an early successional silt bar with and without alder in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest. Biomass by species and carbon and nitrogen pools of plants and soils were measured in 2002. Height and survivorship of spruce seedlings were measured in 1992, 1995, and 2002. White spruce  grew more rapidly in the presence of alder during the first six years. After 13 years, however, seedlings planted with alder experienced high mortality due to intensive browsing by snowshoe hares. Alder resulted in greater total biomass and larger carbon and nitrogen pools in plants and soils.</rdfs:comment>
