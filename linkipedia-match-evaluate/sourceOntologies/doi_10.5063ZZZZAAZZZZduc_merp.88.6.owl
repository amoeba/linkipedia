    <rdfs:label>MERP Root decomposition litter bag study data (1988-1989) This data package contains data from the root decomposition litter bag study (1988-1989). Litter bag studies were a series of short-term studies, conducted as part of the decomposition study of MERP (1980-1989). Additional litter bag studies can be found in separate data packages on the KNB. c_conc carbon concentration (mg/g) litter nutrient concentration; To reduce the number of samples analyzed for total carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, ground samples were pooled by species, water depth and collection date prior to chemical analysis. When possible, five litter bag samples were combined to make 1 sample for nutrient analysis. Water depths were stratified into 30-cm intervals: i.e. 0 cm = unflooded, 1- 30 cm = shallow, 31-60 cm = medium,  60-90 cm = deep sites, and &gt;90cm.

Nutrient controls for each species were grouped by species and depth zone, known as 'field control' litter bags (these were litter bags deployed into field and retrieved immediately, in order to estimate loss due to handling). An additional nutrient control was also run for each species on the 'oven/dry weight control' litter bags (these were the litter bags used to estimate the fresh to dry weight ratio for each species). In the data file, only the pooled control nutrient values have been included for each species x water depth (i.e. depth zone) combination; therefore, the litter bag weights of each individual field control or over/dry weight control litter bag combined to make the sample for nutrient analysis, as well as their respective ground numbers, actual water depth of deployment, etc. have not been included.

To determine percent nutrient remaining e.g. percent nitrogen remaining = ((final_odw*n_conc)/(orig_odw*'control nitrogen concentration'))*100, where orig_odw is the corrected fresh weight to estimate initial oven dry weight, and 'control nitrogen concentration' is that recorded from the control litter bags, for a particular species in a particular depth zone (i.e. for Scholochloa (020201), at a dry site (water depth=0cm), control nitrogen concentration = 1.72)</rdfs:label>

note:in order to compare with final_odw (i.e. oven dry weight versus fresh weight), a subsample of material was oven dried at 80 degrees celcius and used to estimate the initial oven-dry weight of each bag by applying a fresh to oven weight conversion factor:

    <rdfs:label>Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP): Root decomposition litter bag study data (1988-1989)</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:comment>The Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was a long-term interdisciplinary study on the ecology of prairie wetlands. A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes a litter bag study on root decomposition, collected as part of the decomposition section of MERP.
	The high primary productivity in wetlands ensures that plant litter production and decomposition are important factors in wetland nutrient budgets. There are 3 components of the litter pool in prairie wetlands: standing litter, fallen litter, and dissolved organic compounds that leach from both standing and fallen litter (Davis and van der Valk, 1978). Material enters the standing litter compartment with the death of the leaf or shoots. In prairie marshes, litter is transferred from the standing litter compartment to fallen litter primarily through fragmentation by wind, snow, and ice action. In areas of high muskrat activity, feeding and house building can result in living plant tissues directly entering the fallen litter stage. Once within the fallen litter compartment, decomposition rates increase due to the growth of bacteria, fungi, and other consumers on the litter particles. (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). 
	The MERP decomposition studies are a series of short-term studies examining the decomposition rates of both above- and belowground components of the dominant emergent species and the transfer of litter from the standing to the fallen litter compartment within the experimental cells (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). Three types of decomposition studies were conducted: litterbag studies, dead standing litter (clip plot) studies and matching stems (permanent clips) studies.The objective of this short-term decomposition study was to examine the belowground decomposition and nutrient dynamics of the root and rhizome litters of the dominant emergent macrophytes present in the Delta Marsh, Manitoba (Wrubleski, Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1997; Nelson, 1988).

An additional nutrient control was also run for each species on the 'oven/dry weight control' litter bags (these were the litter bags used to estimate the fresh to dry weight ratio for each species). In the data file, only the pooled control nutrient values have been included for each species x water depth (i.e. depth zone) combination; therefore, the litter bag weights of each individual field control or over/dry weight control litter bag combined to make the sample for nutrient analysis, as well as their respective ground numbers, actual water depth of deployment, etc. have not been included.

To determine percent nutrient remaining e.g. percent nitrogen remaining = ((final_odw*n_conc)/(orig_odw*'control nitrogen concentration'))*100, where orig_odw is the corrected fresh weight to estimate initial oven dry weight, and 'control nitrogen concentration' is that recorded from the control litter bags, for a particular species in a particular depth zone (i.e. for Scholochloa (020201), at a dry site (water depth=0cm), control nitrogen concentration = 1.72)</rdfs:label>

note:in order to compare with final_odw (i.e. oven dry weight versus fresh weight), a subsample of material was oven dried at 80 degrees celcius and used to estimate the initial oven-dry weight of each bag by applying a fresh to oven weight conversion factor:
if species = 010103 then corrected weight (orig_odw) = fresh_wt*0.412
if species = 020101 then corrected weight (orig_odw) = fresh_wt*0.618
if species = 020201 then corrected weight (orig_odw) = fresh_wt*0.507
if species = 030100 then corrected weight (orig_odw) = fresh_wt*0.549

    <rdfs:label>c_conc carbon concentration (mg/g) litter nutrient concentration; To reduce the number of samples analyzed for total carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, ground samples were pooled by species, water depth and collection date prior to chemical analysis. When possible, five litter bag samples were combined to make 1 sample for nutrient analysis. Water depths were stratified into 30-cm intervals: i.e. 0 cm = unflooded, 1- 30 cm = shallow, 31-60 cm = medium,  60-90 cm = deep sites, and &gt;90cm.

Nutrient controls for each species were grouped by species and depth zone, known as 'field control' litter bags (these were litter bags deployed into field and retrieved immediately, in order to estimate loss due to handling). An additional nutrient control was also run for each species on the 'oven/dry weight control' litter bags (these were the litter bags used to estimate the fresh to dry weight ratio for each species). In the data file, only the pooled control nutrient values have been included for each species x water depth (i.e. depth zone) combination; therefore, the litter bag weights of each individual field control or over/dry weight control litter bag combined to make the sample for nutrient analysis, as well as their respective ground numbers, actual water depth of deployment, etc. have not been included.
